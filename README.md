## React/TS Weather App

This is the 3rd and final iteration of my weather app. It has been a long process and amazing to see my coding skills evolved, from when I was first learning how vanilla javascript and geolocation works to creating an app using React and typescript 3 months later, while testing the api using Postman and mockAPI servers; all technologies that i've never used previously !
